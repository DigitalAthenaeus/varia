# Criteria for Analysis

- Specifically named persons.
- Groups representative of literary genres. E.g. "the poets after Archilochus", or, "the Athenian orators" (οἱ Ἀθήνησι ῥήτορες).
- Not general ethnics. So "the Athenian Orators", but not "the Athenians" or "Athens".

## Problems, Questions and our (temporary) Decisions

- 1.2 "Ποντιανὸς καὶ Δημόκριτος οἱ Νικομηδεῖς" These are clearly two named-entities. Do we want a third, "The Nicomedeans"? Answer: No. They are not equivalent to the "Sons of Atreus" in the Iliad; if in the text Athenaeus ever mentions "the Nicoemedeans", we can analyze that twice, as both Pontianus and Demokritos." If reading the text suggests otherwise, we can revisit this.
